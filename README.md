Once you have installed those dependencies and cloned this repo you need to run the following:

1. Move into the correct directory
```
cd florence
```
2. Run the server
```
make debug
```

3. Browse to the Florence homepage http://localhost:8081/florence/index.html

4. If you are running Florence for the first time you will need to login with the setup credentials. You will be asked to change this password.
