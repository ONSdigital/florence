### Getting started

To run Florence you must have [Golang](https://golang.org/) installed on a UNIX machine.

Once you have installed those dependencies and cloned this repo you need to run the following:

1. Move into the correct directory
```
cd florence
```
2. Build node modules (you won't need to do this everytime only when the assets need to be rebuilt)
```
make node-modules
```
3. Run the server
```
make debug
```

Steps 2 & 3 can also be run with the following command:
```
make dev
```
This will build the node modules and then run the server

3. Browse to the Florence homepage http://localhost:8081/florence

4. If you are running Florence for the first time you will need to login with the setup credentials. You will be asked to change this password.
