## Getting started

To run Florence you must have:

1. [Golang](https://golang.org/) installed:

   ```shell
   brew install go
   ```

1. [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed:

   ```shell
   brew install nvm
   ```

   :warning: Make sure to follow the instructions provided at the end of the install to configure up your shell profile.

1. The node version specified in [`.nvmrc`](./.nvmrc) installed through nvm:

   ```shell
   nvm install
   ```

Once you have installed those dependencies and cloned this repo you need to run the following:

1. Move into the correct directory

    ```shell
    cd florence
    ```

1. Build node modules (you won't need to do this everytime only when the assets need to be rebuilt)

   ```shell
   make node-modules
   ```

1. Run the server

   ```shell
   make debug
   ```

Steps 2 & 3 can also be run with the following command:

```shell
make dev
```

This will build the node modules and then run the server

1. Browse to the Florence homepage http://localhost:8081/florence

1. If you are running Florence for the first time you will need to login with the setup credentials. You will be asked to change this password.
