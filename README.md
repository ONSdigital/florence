### Getting started

To run Florence you must have [Golang](https://golang.org/) installed on a UNIX machine.

Once you have installed those dependencies and cloned this repo you need to run the following:

1. Move into the correct directory
```
cd florence
```
2. Run the server
```
make debug
```

3. Browse to the Florence homepage http://localhost:8081/florence/index.html

4. If you are running Florence for the first time you will need to login with the setup credentials. You will be asked to change this password.

Username: florence@magicroundabout.ons.gov.uk
Password: Doug4l

#### Optional (for developing Florence)

3. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
4. Watch for JS, CSS and other source file changes
```
make watch-src
```
