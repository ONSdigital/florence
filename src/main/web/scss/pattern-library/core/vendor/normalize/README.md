# Normalize


Normalize and apply ultra-minimal base typography
You shouldnt need to edit this file.
Were using a modified version of Normalize v1.1.2 which supports legacy support for IE 6/7/8/9 and Firefox 3.
Upgrade to v2 at the appropriate time


Normalize does
- provide x-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements
- correct some common bugs

Normalize does not
- reset/undo *eveything*, which would create a large inheritance chain and complicate debugging
- impose a visual starting point
