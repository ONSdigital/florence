# Library CSS

 - Normalise / reset
 - Helper classes
 - Basic print styles
 - Skiplinks

You shouldn't need to edit the CSS in this directory on a per-project basis.

If you do, append -mod to the file name, and add some SASS comments into the head of the file, describing the rationale for the change. Then, we can evaluate the changes post-project and decide if we want to merge them back into our boilerplate.
